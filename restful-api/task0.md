# Basics of HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP is a protocol that allows communication between a browser and a web server. It is used to request and receive web pages. However, HTTP, is not secure because the data is sent in plain text.

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect the data. This means that sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers cannot be easily intercepted. The main difference is that HTTPS encrypts the data while HTTP does not.

## An HTTP request contains :

- A method (like GET or POST)
- A path (the resource requested)
- Headers
- Sometimes a body

## An HTTP responce contains :

- A status code (like 200 or 404)
- Headers
- A body (the content returned)

## Common HTTP methods :

- GET -> Retrieve data (example : load a webpage)
- POST -> Send data (example : submit a form)
- PUT -> Update data
- DELETE -> Remove data

## Common status codes : 

- 200 OK -> Request successful
- 301 Moved Permanently -> Resource moved
- 400 Bad Request -> invalid request
- 404 Not Found -> Resource not found
- 500 internal Server Error -> Server problem

In conclusion, HTTPS is more secure than HTTPS.
